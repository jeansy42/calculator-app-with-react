## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The development of this project was important as it was my first time using React and putting its main concepts into practice. Developing the logic for the calculator to make it as close as possible to professional ones was quite a challenge, which required me to use regular expressions, a term that many find complex. Overall, I learned much more about Javascript, its frameworks, and programming in general.

### Continued development

I intend to continue developing my skills in JavaScript and React through the creation of more complex projects, making my knowledge increasingly useful, and ultimately securing my first job as a programmer.
